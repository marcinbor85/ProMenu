# ProMenu Library
ProMenu Library is used for fast implementing advanced user menus.
It supports nesting, numeric settings, text settings and events.
Library is implemented in C++ with build-in Arduino port, but it is easy to
port to different architecture.

## Features
* asynchronous non-blocking API based on events callbacks
* fully static implementation without dynamic allocation
* hardware independent high-level architecture
* abstract display interface, for easy porting
* object-oriented architecture for easy extending
* data independent model with interface classes
* support numeric, text, and choices settings
* most of the configurable items can be placed at flash without ram
* limited only by available memoroy number of menu/submenu items
* build-in ready to use driver adapters classes
* easy to use with Arduino boards (with separated drivers depencency)
* correct handling of single and multi-line displays
* customizable display clipping, leaves remaining area for application
